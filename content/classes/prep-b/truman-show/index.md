## Background

What if your life is a soap opera? The Truman Show is all about this.
The Truman Show written by Andrew Niccol, directed by Peter Weir and starring
Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank.

## Plot

The film shows us Truman Burbank and his fake life in a reality show named
"The Truman Show". This show films the whole life of Truman from his birth 7/24
live and Truman doesn't know his life is a lie since his birth.
But on a normal day he sees his father whom he thought was dead and
after that he starts to doubt about his life.

## My Views

I think Jim Carrey is the chosen one for the Truman Burbank role, he fits in
absolutely perfect, the soundtrack is good enough for the movie and the storyline
is as gripping as my father's BBQ parties. The Movie has very good quotes and
clips around the internet.

## Suggestions

For me The Truman Show is a "Must Watch" movie for everyone because
of today's problems like private life and its protection.

## Sayonara

I want to finish this text with the most iconic quotes from the movie.

> "...in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!"  
> ~Truman Burbank
