+++

Last weekend, my friend Josuke Higashikata invited me to visiting Morioh-cho.
It's a suburb of S-city, located in the east of Japan and is connected to the sea.
Morioh is famous for its peaceful and quiet atmosphere and I must admit this is
really true.

I flew to S-city and after that I weet to Morioh-cho by taxi because there is no
airstrip on Morioh. When I got there, I noticed there is not many people on the
streets, and it was so quiet. After some waiting, Josuke and his nephew Jotaro
arrived, and then they greeted me.

We went to Trattoria Trussardi for launch, it's a local restaurant which have strange
menu logic. The restaurant itself very clean, comfortable and _normal_, but when it comes
to menu... There is no menu which you can choose something, chef decides what will customer
eats. Without forgetting, the price is same for anyone. The price is affordable and chef
knows what he is doing. The meal was so well and I think Trattoria Trussardi is a must
even if you don't like Italian cuisine.

After launch, they started to showing me around the town. First, we went to Anjuro Rock.
It's a rock which looks like a face and saluting it a tradition at Morioh.

Second, we went to the Boing-Boing Cape. - I dunno why its name is like that but it
is - It's a cliff and it has a breathtaking view. I almost fell, but it was worth it.

Next, we went to Kameyu Department Store. It's a normal shopping mall, nothing interesting.
I bought some souvenirs at there.

After all this tour, we went to Josuke's house and we played games from his console.
At like 9 p.m. I went to Morioh Grand Hotel with Jotaro.

Next day, I said goodbye and continued to my Japan travel.

I think Morioh-cho is quite well for living in. Quiet, peaceful... what can I say more.
