Social media harms our attention span, just like it harms many
other things in our lives. Today, there are 5.22 billion social
media users worldwide. On average, a social media user spends 2
hours and 19 minutes on social media every day. However, this is
not just time spent for fun. It also trains our brains to need
constant stimulation, making it harder to focus and think deeply.

Social media shows people different emotions in a very short time.
A person might watch a funny video one moment and see a sad or
angry post right after. These fast emotional changes make the brain
less patient and lower attention span. Over time, people also become
less emotional because they get used to these quick changes.

Statistics show that since 2004, the average attention span has
shrunk almost three times. In the past, people could read long texts,
focus on one topic, and think deeply for longer periods. But now,
because of fast content consumption, it is more difficult to read
long articles, stay focused, and work on complex subjects.

This problem also affects education, work, and social life. Research
shows that people addicted to social media have lower work efficiency,
struggle to learn new things, and are less attentive in face-to-face
communication. In todayâ€™s world, meaningful communication and deep
thinking are becoming more important, but social media is making
these skills weaker.

To solve this issue, digital detox, conscious social media use, and
focus techniques are important. Otherwise, we may create a generation
that cannot concentrate, is satisfied with only short content, and
loses deep thinking skills.
