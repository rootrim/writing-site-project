It\u0026rsquo;s a suburb of S-city, located in the east of Japan and is connected to the sea. Morioh is famous for its peaceful and quiet atmosphere and I must admit this is really true.\nI flew to S-city and after that I weet to Morioh-cho by taxi because there is no airstrip on Morioh. When I got there, I noticed there is not many people on the streets, and it was so quiet. After some waiting, Josuke and his nephew Jotaro arrived, and then they greeted me.\nWe went to Trattoria Trussardi for launch, it\u0026rsquo;s a local restaurant which have strange menu logic. The restaurant itself very clean, comfortable and normal, but when it comes to menu\u0026hellip; There is no menu which you can choose something, chef decides what will customer eats. Without forgetting, the price is same for anyone. The price is affordable and chef knows what he is doing. The meal was so well and I think Trattoria Trussardi is a must even if you don\u0026rsquo;t like Italian cuisine.\nAfter launch, they started to showing me around the town. First, we went to Anjuro Rock. It\u0026rsquo;s a rock which looks like a face and saluting it a tradition at Morioh.\nSecond, we went to the Boing-Boing Cape. - I dunno why its name is like that but it is - It\u0026rsquo;s a cliff and it has a breathtaking view. I almost fell, but it was worth it.\nNext, we went to Kameyu Department Store. It\u0026rsquo;s a normal shopping mall, nothing interesting. I bought some souvenirs at there.\nAfter all this tour, we went to Josuke\u0026rsquo;s house and we played games from his console. At like 9 p.m. I went to Morioh Grand Hotel with Jotaro.\nNext day, I said goodbye and continued to my Japan travel.\nI think Morioh-cho is quite well for living in. Quiet, peaceful\u0026hellip; what can I say more.\n","date":"17 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writing-site-project/classes/prep-b/visiting-morioh/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Visiting Morioh","type":"classes"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writing-site-project/tags/homework/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Homework","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writing-site-project/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Background # What if your life is a soap opera? The Truman Show is all about this. The Truman Show written by Andrew Niccol, directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank.\nPlot # The film shows us Truman Burbank and his fake life in a reality show named \u0026ldquo;The Truman Show\u0026rdquo;. This show films the whole life of Truman from his birth 7/24 live and Truman doesn\u0026rsquo;t know his life is a lie since his birth. But on a normal day he sees his father whom he thought was dead and after that he starts to doubt about his life.\nMy Views # I think Jim Carrey is the chosen one for the Truman Burbank role, he fits in absolutely perfect, the soundtrack is good enough for the movie and the storyline is as gripping as my father\u0026rsquo;s BBQ parties. The Movie has very good quotes and clips around the internet.\nSuggestions # For me The Truman Show is a \u0026ldquo;Must Watch\u0026rdquo; movie for everyone because of today\u0026rsquo;s problems like private life and its protection.\nSayonara # I want to finish this text with the most iconic quotes from the movie.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;in case I don\u0026rsquo;t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!\u0026rdquo;\n~Truman Burbank\n","date":"8 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writing-site-project/classes/prep-b/truman-show/","section":"","summary":"","title":"The Truman Show","type":"classes"},{"content":" Preparetion Class A # This class\u0026rsquo;s class teacher is mustafa gok!
